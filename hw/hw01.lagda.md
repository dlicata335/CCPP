# Propositions as types exercies

For each of the following propositions, translate the proposition to a
type. Prove the proposition by giving a program of that type.

```
  -- (R ∨ (S ∧ T)) ⊃ (R ∨ S) ∧ (R ∨ T)
  distrib∨∧ : {!!}
  distrib∨∧ = {!!}

  -- ( (R ∨ S) ∧ (R ∨ T) ) ⊃ (R ∨ (S ∧ T)) 
  undistrib∨∧ : {!!}
  undistrib∨∧ = {!!}

  -- (R ∧ (S ∨ T)) ⊃ (R ∧ S) ∨ (R ∧ T)
  distrib∧∨ : {!!}
  distrib∧∨ = {!!}

  -- ((R ∧ S) ∨ (R ∧ T)) ⊃ (R ∧ (S ∨ T))

# Clue

The following puzzle is derived from the game Clue. A player has various pieces of
information regarding the perpetrator, the weapon, and the location of a murder:

If Mr. Green is guilty, then it was with the candle-stick in the
billiard room or with the revolver in the hall. If it was in the hall,
then Miss Scarlet did it. Either it was done with the revolver, or in
the hall.

From these facts, a player must make inferences about who committed the
crime, such as:

Therefore Mr. Green didn’t do it.

Formalize this situation and show that MrGeen is not guilty.

We will define logical negation (not) as folows
```
  -- type \neg to enter this symbol
  ¬ : Set → Set
  ¬ A = (A → Void)
```

This says that (not A) is true when A implied the false proposition Void.  

```
  module Clue (MrGreenGuilty MissScarletGuilty Revolver CandleStick BillardRoom Hall : Set) where

    -- The proposition MrGreenGuilty means Mr Green is guilty
    -- the proposition MissScarletGuilty means Miss Scarlet is not guilty
    -- The proposition Revolver means the murder weapon was the revolver
    -- The proposition CandleStick means the murder weapon was the candlestick
    -- The proposition BillardRoom means the murder took place in the billard room
    -- The proposition Hall means the murder took place in the hall

    -- Translate the problem to a type
    clue : -- If Mr. Green is guilty, then it was with the candle-stick in the billiard room or with the revolver in the hall. 
            {!!}
         -- If it was in the hall, then Miss Scarlet is guilty. 
         -> {!!}
         -- Either it was done with the revolver, or in the hall.
         -> {!!}
         -- There was only one murder weapon (i.e. it is not the case that both Revolver and CandleStick are true)
         -> {!!}
         -- There was only one murderer (i.e. it is not the case that both MrGreenGuilty and MissScarletGuilty are true)
         -> {!!}
         -- MrGreen is not guilty
         -> {!!}
    clue = -- Now write a program of that type to exonerate Mr. Green
           {!!}
